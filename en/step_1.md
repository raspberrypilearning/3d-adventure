## You will make

3D adventure is the final project in the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} path. 

In this project, you are going to create a 3D adventure with a goal that the player needs to achieve. Your 3D adventure could be a game, a virtual world, or a visual novel with a goal and one or more endings. 

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

Your project will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">virtual world</span> is a computer environment where players can explore and interact with game objects including non-player characters. A <span style="color: #0faeb0">visual novel</span> is a genre of computer game featuring a story, character development, and player choices.</p>

You will:
+ Use your Unity skills to make a small game or experience
+ Combine 3D GameObjects, Scripts, Animations, Materials, UI, and Sounds 
+ Share your project with others so they can try it out and you can get feedback

### Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">   

Click on the embedded project and complete the minigame challenges. 

Think about the GameObjects including their shape, size, movement, and positions. 
+ How has `SetActive()` been used to create the cage obstacles?  
+ Would you have chosen this camera angle or used different settings?

### PROJECT BRIEF: 3D adventure
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Make a 3D game, virtual world, or visual novel with a goal and one or more endings.

Your project should:
+ Have a Player character and one or more non-player characters or objects
+ Have 3D scenery for the player to explore
+ Tell the player when they have finished with a win or lose message or an ending 

Your project could:
+ Have sound effects
+ Use animations to make your game objects come to life
+ Use text and/or buttons to communicate with the player and get input
