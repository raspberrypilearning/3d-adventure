**Test:** Show someone else your project and get their feedback. Do you want make any changes to your book?

Every time you start work on your game again, begin your work session by replaying." - Emily Short, Game Narrative Designer</p>

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. 

Useful debug tips:
- Turn on the Playmode tint so that you can tell when you are in game mode.
- Click on 'Gizmos' in Playmode and then click on a game object in the Inspector to view its colliders.
- Look at the values of public variables in the Inspector in Playmode to see how they are changing. 
- Use `Debug.Log()` to print messages to the Console to understand what's happening. 
- Check the Console for errors. Script errors also appear in the bar at the bottom of the editor.

title: My patrolling characters do not move/face the right way

Think about the coordinates in your script: 
+ Are you moving along the correct `x`, `y`, `z` axis? 
+ Are you using the positive and negative values you need for your movement range.

Look at the character in the Inspector. Is your character rotated to face in the direction you wish to move?
