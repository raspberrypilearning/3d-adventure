## Your idea

You can build on the world and quest that you developed in the Design projects, or if you have enough time you can start a completely new project. 

Use this step to plan your project. You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing or writing, or however you like!

### What is the goal ?

--- task ---

What is the goal of your game, mission or story?

It could be:
- Completing a set of minigames and collecting all the coins. 
- Finding out who the thief was in a mystery story. 
- Completing multiple quests to find all the ingredients for a recipe. 

--- /task ---

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your project for (your **audience**).

--- /task ---

### Game design

- What camera angle do you want
- How will the player controls work, will your player be able to walk backwards?
- How will you use scenery, animations and sound effects to create the right atmosphere?
- What are the important states and conditions for your game? What variables will you need to track these?

### Get started

--- task ---

Open the project you have been working on during this path and create a new scene.

**invent starter** builds on the project created in the rest of the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target=blank} path and it is recommended that you complete those first. 

If you have not compeleted the rest of the path, or are not able to open your previous project, you can download and open the [invent starter](path){:target=
} template project that contains a collection of useful assets.

### Unity basics

--- task ---

Personalise the Unity editor to create the most efficient environment for you to create your project.

title: Customise your Unity editor layout
---

You can customise the Unity editor to have the layout that is easiest for you to navigate. 

Unity has a number of predefined layouts that you can chose from by clicking on the **Layout** dropdown box and selecting your chosen view. 

![The expanded Layout dropdown box in the top-right corner of the Unity editor showing predifined layout options.](images/path.png)

You can customise these layouts by clicking on the tab at the top of any of the Scene view and Game view, or Hierachy, Project and Inspector windows and dragging them to a new position.

After customising a layout you can save it to use again later by clicking on the **Layout** dropdown box and selecting **Save Layout...**.

title: Add Playmode tint to show when your project is running
---

It is useful to add a colour tint to the editor whilst it is in Playmode. This makes it easy to tell whether your scene is running or not. 

![Side my side image of the Unity editor without tint and with tint.](images/path.png)

To set a tint, go to the **Unity** menu and select **Preferences**. Choose the **Colours** menu and find the property called **Playmode tint**.

![The Preferences window with Colour menu expanded and Playmode tint highlighted.](images/path.png)

Click on the existing colour to see a colour wheel where you can choose a colour and opacity level.

![The colour wheel pop up window with a blue medium opacity tint selected.](images/path.png)

Return to the Unity editor and press the **Play** button to see your new tint in action.

title: Connect your preferred Script editor
---

When writing scripts for your game objects, the files will open using an external script editor. You can change the default to open in an editor of your choice. 

Go to the **Unity** menu and select **Preferences**. Choose the **External Tools** menu and find the property called **External Script Editor**.

Click on the drop-down menu and choose **Browse...** then find the tool you wish to use.

Think about how you can make your project with the Unity skills you have learned. If there's anything that you haven't learned yet then try and adjust your ideas so you will be able to build your project. 

Note down things you don't know how to do yet so you can find out how to do them in future.
